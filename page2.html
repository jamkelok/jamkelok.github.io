        <h2>IFRS 16 - leases (the new leases standard)  </h2>
        <p>
            On 13 January 2016 the International Accounting Standard Board issued a new accounting standard, called IFRS 16 - Leases. This standard replaces accounting requirements which were introduced over thirty years ago. It is a major revision of the way in which companies account for leases. The new standard is formed after multiple rounds of public consultation and has been part of collaborations with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). It will have an impact on all organisations, particularly those with major assets under operating leases. This course is designed to bring delegates up-to-date with this standard for lease accounting, and is therefore suitable for delegates with existing knowledge of the current lease accounting standard under IFRS (IAS 17 - Leases) applied consistently to complex transactions across a wide range of industries under both IFRS and US GAAP.

        <p>
            TThe main proposal is for lessees to bring all leases onto the balance sheet and eliminate the current lessee accounting treatment for operating leases and finance leases under IAS 17. The proposals are likely to have a major impact on companies which lease significant high value items such as the airline, transport and retail sectors.
